# How does it work?

`The app creates a dynamical list of phones based on the data found in a collective JSON file.`

`The results can be filtered and sorted via search and sort by functions.`

`Clicking a phone image will lead to a phone-detail template that is dynamically populated with data from that particular phone's dedicated JSON file.`
